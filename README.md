# Java 17 to 21 Features

There are many, many changes and enhancements to the Java language
and the JVM between long-term support (LTS) versions 17 and 21.
While it is too much to demonstrate and discuss every single one of
those changes and enhancements, this project highlights some of the
new features that might be of most interest to the majority of Java
developers.

In an attempt to introduce all the different features in a clean,
clear way, this project is a collection of modules in which each
module is its own individual explanation (with its own README) for
the feature covered by that module.

The modules for new features in Java 21 presented in this project
are:

* Record patterns
* Pattern matching for switch
* Sequenced collections
* Virtual threads

## Preview Features

* String templates
* Unnamed classes and instance main methods
* Unnamed patterns and variables
* Structured concurrency
* Scoped values

## Topics from Java 11 to 17 Project

These are retained for reference only and will be deleted once more
content is added to this README and this project.
